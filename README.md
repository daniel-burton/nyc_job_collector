# NYC Job Collector: 
## A simple script to collect all currently open NYC government jobs and list them on a Flask site

* It works! Scrapes all jobs in all categories and collects agency, title, etc. 
* Now creates a .json of all the scraped jobs.
* Working on making simple Flask site to list the jobs and provide links.
* I like simple html but will read up on making it a tiny bit cuter.
* Need to read up on jinja templates
* Also need to make the flask app load the .json

* Is it only fetching the first page of results?
