# NYC Job Collector: 
## A simple script to collect all currently open NYC government jobs and list them on a Flask site

* it is only fetching the first page of results
* now running at https://nyc-job-collector.herokuapp.com/
* realized why it won't update-- I need to save the jobs on an external database rather than on the heroku container. Looking into what the easiest option is.
